This app is designed to create a romatic movie viewing enviornment, by connecting your phone with you ATT Digital Life platform.  Programmed by Nicholas Carroll, James Marvin, Maggie Thomann, Paul Lee, and Ryan Michalec.  This app went on to win the award for "best use of ATT digital life" and won $1000.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
The app will crash when the chill button is pressed, or when a specified setting is pressed that is associated with digital life.  This seems to be because login creditials are hard coded in the program and have since expired
